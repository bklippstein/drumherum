== $LOAD_PATH management
+smart_init+ finds the directory named 'lib' in your project and adds
* the (main) directory above
* the lib-directory itself 
to Rubys $LOAD_PATH. So your require statements load the actual version from your project directory, not the gem version.

Usage (wherever you are in the directory hierarchy of your project):
  if $0 == __FILE__ 
    require 'drumherum'
    smart_init 
  end
  require 'my-gem-project'  

== Rake tasks for deployment
  rake publish               # publish all on github and rubygems, reinstall gem
  rake git_publish           # publish actual version to github  
  rake git_publish_docs      # publish docs to github
  rake rubygems_publish      # release actual version to rubygems

== Unit Tests
You will see a status display for your tests if you use UnitTest instead of Test::Unit::TestCase:
